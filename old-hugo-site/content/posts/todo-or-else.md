A small utility I'm working on that helps you make sure TODO comments are completed. 

Get it here [github.com/jwelch92/todo-or-else](https://github.com/jwelch92/todo-or-else).

I'm following along with the excellent [Hypermodern Python](https://cjolowicz.github.io/posts/hypermodern-python-01-setup/) guide for things
like testing, CI, linting, etc.
