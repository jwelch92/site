### Argo Rollouts New Relic metricprovider

Pull Request: [feat: Add New Relic metricprovider #772](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/pull/772) 
([Docs](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/analysis/newrelic/))



I contributed a metric provider to the Argo Rollouts project while working at New Relic. This integration allows users of Argo Rollouts
and New Relic to run analysis using NRQL queries.
