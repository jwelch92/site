- Create separate templates for regular posts and TIL
    - adidoks has a great example of this with the docs and blog sections. https://github.com/aaranxu/adidoks/tree/main/content/docs. 
      Each section of content can specify which template to use. Each page can also specify a template to use.

Design goals
- Very fast, 100 lighthouse would be great. 
- Search
- Tags and categories
- Clean, readable typography
- Very good code formatting and syntax highlighting, including copy support
- Light to no JS
- Light on CSS


One long, flat scroll with all posts.
Posts are clickable and will go to a specific page for that post. 
Posts can have different types and may render differently off the index page. 
No hierarchy. 
Sections based on taxonomy. Probably just tags to start with. 
    For example, clicking on tag #python will give a listing (with or without the content, not sure yet) of all posts tagged #python.
