# Hello world

This is the start of my personal blog/site intended to serve as a place for guides, writings, and links to my other online presence. There will likely be content on Kubernetes, Go, Python, and my favorite: command line tools. 

Iâ€™m currently employed as a Software Engineer at New Relic, Inc. in their Portland, OR office. Before that I worked at eBay for 4 years doing mobile build and release.
